Although sometimes I stumble upon 'stories' which are stranger than fiction (which I share on Facebook), on a regular day, my life is boring as heck...

I get up, have my breakfast, mostly Chocos with coffee :P, go to college. I sit in one corner of the class, listen to what the teachers say.

If the lecture is BORING or HIGHLY INTERESTING, I ask questions. I ask questions to confuse the lecturer and my fellow classmates if it is a 'boring' lecture. And if the lecture is something 'highly interesting', I ask questions to initiate a debate... :D

And if the lecture is HIGHLY BORING, I make sketches in class :P

During lunch, I grab a bite from everyone I consider a friend. It doesn't matter if the person too considers me as a friend :P

Then I spend my own money to eat something more... :D And once I am full, I sing and dance (literally) with my classmates...

After I return home in the evening, I share everything with my best friend. Then I have coffee.

I spend the rest of the evening and night, till I fall asleep (if at all; I am insomniac, you see), reading a lot, writing 4000 words, and making sketches...

Some nights, I get moderately drunk, and those nights, I just read poetry... And sometimes, I get super drunk and tell my girlfriend that I love her - the only time I tell her these three words...

That's my life. I barely go out partying with friends. I never go for a long ride. I don't even chat much...

But my dreams, the ones I live when I get a sleep, are so interesting...

That's where I meet my favourite fictional characters: the Hobbits, Gandalf, Harry Potter, Dumbledore, Captain Jack Sparrow, Jack and Rose (from Titanic), Dr House, Saleem Sinai (from The Midnight's Children), and the likes.

Sometimes they all even appear in the same dream...

It is in my dreams I spend great time with Sunny Leone... :P and I meet the likes of Einstein, Karl Marx, Ghalib, even Hitler :D

My dreams are damn interesting...

But yesterday morning, I dreamt of 'Expressionism' : the art movement... At the same time, the dream also featured Laura Mulvey's 'Male Gaze' Theory... And I also saw a glimpse of Edvard Munch's painting, 'The Scream'.

And it didn't make sense at all... I couldn't connect the THREE dots.

I thought it was all because of the academic pressures...

The last Film Studies class was about Expressionism. And I paid extra-attention in the class. I also tried to read about it when I came back home, but it didn't make any sense to me at that time...

Also my dissertation is about 'reading' films. So I had read about the 'Male Gaze' Theory of Laura Mulvey, although it wasn't relevant to my study...

And I haven't painted for a while for all these pressures...

So... I thought that thanks to the pressures in college, even my dreams are becoming "academic" with a tinge of "frustration" these days... I was sad.

Anyway, just a little while back, I read about Edvard Munch's 'The Scream' just out of curiosity...

And I discovered that 'The Scream' is an Expressionist painting :D

Two of the three dots got connected :D IN A DREAM :D I understood Expressionism in a dream :D :D :D

I realised that I think rationally even in my dreams...I realised that I should take my dreams seriously...

And so, right now, a part of me is trying to connect the third dot: Laura Mulvey's Eye Gaze theory to Expressionism and Edvard Munch...

The other part is wondering if my Sunny Leone dreams too should be taken seriously
