It was a Grand Alumni Meet programme.

I won't disclose if it was a grand gathering of my "mates" from school or college, for reasons that will be obvious when you reach the end of this post.

Anyway, the socially-awkward me, who usually ignores this kind of social gatherings, decided to attend this one for some inexplicable reason...

When I reached there, I realised I didn't know most of them who attended the programme. Of course, I didn't mind that... for it meant I wasn't obligated to exchange pleasantries with them.

There were a few who I knew (or remembered). But it seemed like they didn't remember me... maybe don't even know me, for I was mostly the "invisible" guy during my days at that institution. I don't mind that either, because I didn't have any memorable memories with them.

And there were a few who didn't know me personally, and I didn't know them either, but we were Facebook friends. They came and spoke to me... "I don't remember you. But when I came across your posts on Facebook, I checked your profile... And I discovered that we're from the same 'school/college'... And you write so good... I sent you a friend request...," they said something like that.

It was easy to deal with these people. You smile, you ask which batch they are from, what they are doing these days... And then Bye bye...

I had a good time among those strangers...

But while I was leaving, getting in my car, a girl came upto me...

"Hey, you stay near ABCDEFG, right? Could you please drop me there?"

She was right about my location. And it was 11 at night; so she probably assumed that I would go back home from the programme.

"Sure," I said...

She got into the car.

"You are from the 1234 batch, right? Do you remember Santa Clause (name changed)?" She asked.

"I remember her vaguely. I think I had held her hands, and she had held mine.. "

"And yet you REMEMBER HER VAGUELY?"

"I have a psychological problem. I forget dead people... "

She asked me to stop the car. I stopped.

She got down, took an auto, and left...

She didn't know that I followed the auto till she reached her place...

Just like I used to do when we were together
