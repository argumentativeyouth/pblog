The Sabarimala Ayyappa temple's chief priest said, "The chief deity in the temple is a celibate. So allowing women to worship in the shrine is a sin."

So worshipping is synonymous with seducing? Then why is the chief deity OK with men entering the temple? Is he gay? Then why not accept the LGBTs which will ultimately lead to striking down of Article 377? Why these double standards?

Oh, wait. He is a celibate. But what sort of celibacy is that when you need to boycott women completely to abstain from sexual relations? Doesn't it mean that deep inside he is super-horny, one who gets turned on by just staring at women?

Doesn't it also mean that no matter what a woman does, it always amounts to have a sexual association? Even if it is something as 'pure' and 'divine' as worshipping?

Ayyappan or whoever the chief deity is, and his followers, the day women boycott you completely, your 'business' will shut down, for women have the power to make sure that the next generation doesn't see your (or any of your types) face.

Aur sirf 'celibate' hokey kya fayda? Chutiya banake jo logo se paisa lete ho, tab? Rs 203.15 crore in 63 day pilgrim season? Hypocrite...
