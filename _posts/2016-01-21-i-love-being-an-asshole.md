I love being an asshole to most of the people.

For example, if a girl asks me, "How is my new hair cut?" I will probably say, "It's ugly as shit," not because it's really ugly, although it might be so. I will say so because I want to gauge the sincerity in their willingness to know how it really looks.

The most deceptive thing about humans is their ability to communicate verbally. Unfortunately this ability of humans to communicate verbally is one of the reasons why we are called social animals. The concept of society, thus, has a negative connotation associated with it.

Imagine a society where everybody is damn honest.

"How is the food?"
"It's yuck..."
"Go, cook for yourself..."

"Hey, I met a new guy. He is so hot."
"May be he is hot, but he is pathetic in the bed."
And the three of them never talked to each other.

"India is intolerant."
"Go to Pakistan."

"Religion is bullshit..."
And you are dead.

Society exists because people say things others want to hear.

And that I do not comply by it makes me an asshole. And trust me, it's so much fun...

The first conversation in this post is real, and it happened few days back. The girl, a pretty one, got pissed off at my response, thus proving my point that society stands on fake conversations...

Another girl heard this conversation and asked me later, "You really don't care about wooing pretty girls, do you?"

I quoted Marcel Proust,"Let us leave pretty women to men with no imagination..."

She thought it was my quote.

Boy, that look on her face... I realized being an asshole and well-read at the same time is sexy...

Damn, I am such am egoist :D

But I realized I was, at this point, honest...

For I fell in love with Pallabi long before I saw her... She was my phone friend.
