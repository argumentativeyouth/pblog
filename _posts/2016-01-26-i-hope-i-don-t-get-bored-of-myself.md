One of the craziest things about me is that I am absolutely comfortable contemplating the most uncomfortable moments of my life, especially the ones where it was my deeds that ultimately led to the discomfort, the embarrassment. I like to relive those moments. It helps me to understand myself better...

Honestly speaking, I find myself damn interesting as a subject for psychological case studies (not in the academic sense though) and it amazes me to see that knowing the person I am supposed to know the most, the good, the bad, and the ugly sides, could be so interesting... I realize how much we ignore our own selves while passing judgements on others...

Of course, I try to to understand other people as well. Even at the cost of embarrassing myself.

But the problem is once I find out the kind of person they are, I get bored of them, unless of course, I develop some real emotional attachment with them, which barely happens...

Nothing touches me these days; I don't feel anything. Whenever something happens, good or bad, I just relate it to some long lost memory, and I 'know' how it feels like and I react that way, the way I am supposed to... Sometimes I don't even react.

That's the reason why I try to understand people; it gives me a temporary pleasure, the ones you feel when you solve a difficult puzzle... But once you solve it, the same puzzle doesn't excite you anymore... You get bored of them...

It's OK. The world is overpopulated anyway...

But since I am a narcissist, and the subject I love most is my own self, I wonder what will happen once I get to know everything possible about myself?

I hope I don't kill myself of boredom... I hope I don't get bored of myself... I hope I don't stop feeling something new... Anything... Even unhappiness of some sort will do... It just needs to be something new... For it is my thirst for some feeling other than what I have already experienced that keeps me alive...
