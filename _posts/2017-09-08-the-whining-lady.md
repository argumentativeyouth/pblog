title: The Whining Lady

It was the last working day of a colleague. Others had arranged for a cake for her to cut - a small fair well gesture. But she was stuck in a meeting - her last meeting in this organisation.

Another colleague was whining for she was getting late. She had a kid at home but that wasn't the reason she was whining. She just wanted, she said, a piece of that chocolate flavoured cake.

It pissed me off. I was new at the office and didn't know her well. So, I was kind of judging her. Especially because despite being new, I was going to miss the one who was leaving. I had learnt so much from her in the past one month. And there she was complaining about not getting a piece of her favourite cake.

Anyway, she came out of the meeting and the whining lady heaved a sigh of relief. Speeches were made and then the cake was cut.

The whining lady took one large piece. But wait... Don't judge her like I did.

While everybody was busy eating and talking to the one who was leaving, the whining lady silently came out of the crowd and passed the piece of cake to one of the office-bearers - people who usually get unnoticed at such parties.

Then she picked her bag and left...
