Every single day of the last 11 years, Seth Godin published blog posts.

Anybody who follows this marketing monk’s blog would know that Seth’s writings are deep and insightful. His blog is not only a knowledge house of marketing (ethical marketing to be precise) but also teaches one to look at life with a different approach. The qualitative aspect of his writings coupled with the number of blog posts he published that too with such regularity is remarkable.

Seth says:

> Streaks require commitment at first, but then the commitment turns into a practice and the practice into a habit. Habits are much easier to maintain than commitments.

That’s the important thing about writing – it requires commitment. But once you get a hang of it, it becomes easier. Then there won’t be any dearth of things to write about. The more you write, the more your eyes open, and you tend to find something worth writing in everything.

There was a time when I used to write a minimum of 4000 words a day. No matter how busy and hectic my days were, I always ensured to meet my daily quota of words. And even after that, I had a lot to write about. It was like I used to stumble upon stories at every step of my life and I was obsessed with writing – jotting them down.

I cannot write like that anymore. I wouldn’t say that I have got engulfed in the practicalities of life. I still wouldn’t dare to call myself practical. Nor do I care about the so-called responsibilities. But I sure have become busier than before and in that process, I have lost, as some of my friends used to say, my gift of seeing stories.

Seth’s words have made me realize that it’s still possible. I can start writing like a maniac again. All I need to do is pull my socks up and make some time every day to look around me… and write. Even if all I get to see is a blurry world and all I get to write are illegible scribbles.
