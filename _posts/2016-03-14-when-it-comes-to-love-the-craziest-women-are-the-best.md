title: When It Comes To Love, The Craziest Women Are The Best

*I have known some crazy women,*

*But Ruksar was the craziest.*


*And the craziest women*

*Are always the best*

*When it comes to love...*


*And hatred,*


*And she talked a lot about the men she hated.*


*Men, when they go crazy,*

*Drink and kill whom they love,*


*And to kill the one you love*

*Is better than hating them.*


*So*

*Ruksar was the craziest woman*

*And*

*I was a hypocrite- worse than those crazy men*

*Who get drunk,*

*And kill the one they love.*


*Yes, I was once a writer,*

*And she would tell me*

*About those men she hated,*

*And ask me to write about them.*


*And I would yell at her.*

*"Get out of here..."*


*And she would leave*


*And I would write about women,*

*The ones you live and stay with*

*Without having the least bit of idea why...*


*And late at night,*

*When I would go down to dump*

*My empty beer bottles,*

*She would still be sitting there on the stairs...*


*And I would ignore her,*

*Go down and dump the beer bottles,*

*Drag myself,*

*Slam the door,*

*And throw my beer-maddened body on the bed,*

*And pass off...*


*And those nights she spent outside*

*In the freezing cold air,*

*Made her sick.*


*And I didn't have the money to take her to the doctor,*

*I would just sit beside her*

*And try to read her stories*

*About the men she hated:*

*The stories I wrote while she was sleeping.*


*And she would say,*

*"I don't want to talk about them anymore,*

*I want to talk about you..."*


*And it scared me,*


*But she continued anyway,*

*And it was then I realized*

*That the craziest women are the best*

*When it comes to love...*


*And then after a week, she died.*


*And I never wrote stories*

*About women you live and stay with*

*Without having the least bit of idea why...*


*Instead*

*I wrote about women*

*You live and stay with*

*And you know why...*


*And I wrote them*

*While the crazy women I met after Ruksar died*

*Slept peacefully on my stinking bed,*

*After they had shared their stories with me,*

*About men they loved...*

*After I had listened to everything they had to say...*


*And they thought I loved them...*
