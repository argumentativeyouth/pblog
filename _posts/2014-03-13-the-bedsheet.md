*He spends his days there*

*Standing in the balcony*

*With his crutch,*

*Watching the busy street down,*

*Watching people with legs*

*Getting busy with their life,*

*While she sleeps inside*

*All day*

*On the dirty bed,*

*The bed sheet never washed*

*Or changed in last few months,*

*'Cause she works all night.*

*And it hurts him. So,*

*Every evening,*

*When the street lights up in bright colors,*

*And birds and people come back home,*

*He seeks oblivion*

*In a bottle of cheap whisky*

*Before the big men in big cars come*

*To take her,*

*Dressed in bright colors, with them.*

*Bright colors, you see, hurt his eyes.*


*And she comes back*

*Late at night, and*

*Sometimes in the morning*

*And sometimes even later*

*When he has regained consciousness*

*And stands there*

*In the balcony with his crutch.*

*And it hurts her.*


*Nobody ever says anything.*


*And he thinks he should die*

*And she thinks if she died,*

*He would starve to death.*



*And the dirty bed,*

*With the dirty bed sheet,*

*Which was never washed or changed*

*In the last few months,*

*Which has never witnessed*

*The two of them making love,*

*But which has heard his*

*Alcohol driven confessions*

*And has seen her tears,*

*Knows*

*How madly they love each other.*
