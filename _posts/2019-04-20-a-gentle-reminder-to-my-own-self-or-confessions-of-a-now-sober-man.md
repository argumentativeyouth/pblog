title: A Gentle Reminder To My Own Self Or Confessions Of A Now Sober Man

On 6th October 2017, I had my last alcoholic drink. I had been trying to quit it for good for quite some time. Although I was successful in tapering it off to some extent, it wasn't much and I was still drinking every day. 

I guess, I had become alcohol-dependent. I needed more and more to get the desired effect. So, when I reduced my intake, my mental and physical health started deteriorating. I became cranky, rude, abusive. I would feel giddy all the time. My heartbeats were perpetually above 120. I think I had also had tactile hallucinations at times. 

What made it worse was the fact that I had done a lot of research on what happens when you quit alcohol. Those stories of withdrawal symptoms scared the shit out of me. I decided to take professional help. But to prepare myself for that, to go to a professional, took a long time. Eventually, I gathered the courage and on 7th October 2017, I went to the hospital. My counselling and medication started and I stopped drinking from that day. 

I still see my therapist once in two months. But what I am proud of is the fact that I have been clean for almost two years now. 

It wasn't easy. Despite being on medications, there were times when I had extreme cravings. Then there were physical manifestations of quitting alcohol after being a heavy drinker for almost two years, like tremors, palpitations, headache, and the likes. 

How did I manage to resist the temptation? I think there were multiple reasons...

Towards the end of my final year in college, one evening I was drinking with my friends, Reev and Viz, at Reev's place. We were celebrating our soon-to-be graduated status. 

I lost count of how many pegs I had had. I passed out. I do not remember most of what happened that night. Apparently, I threw the glass from the terrace. Then just dropped down on the floor. 

When I woke up, it was late at night. I wanted to go back home but Reev and Viz wouldn't let me go. 

With all these commotion going on, Reev's aunt came upstairs. Seems like I hugged her and told her how much I missed my girlfriend, who was then with her parents and not in Bangalore.

As cute as it sounds, I was extremely disappointed with myself. I had never lost control over myself like this before.

A few months after that incident, when I was trying to taper off my alcohol intake, I had to stay at Reev's place for a few days. This time, it was my girlfriend's parents who were in Bangalore. They were not aware that their daughter was in a live-in relationship. So, of course, I had to pack my bags... 

During my stay a Reev's place, one day, it seems, his mom asked him if I was a drug addict. Reev told me about it later. 

This was probably the first time I saw myself through the eyes of someone else - someone who was not used to seeing me on a daily basis. My girlfriend, friends, colleagues (I had started working by then) - they would see me every day. To them, the drunk me was probably the normal thing. Not for Reev's mom... 

Anyway, I realized what drinking had done to me.

The very next week, I went to the hospital...

Why did I start tapering off? 

It was guilt... The guilt of what my girlfriend had to go through every night because of me. The guilt of reeking of alcohol every night as I passed out beside her while she laid awake. Occasionally, I would get romantic and try to kiss her. And one day, I even tried to force myself on her. I will never forget that, nor forgive myself ever. 

I wonder why she put up with me despite everything.

Why did I start drinking in the first place? 

It was the easiest way to deal with my demons, I guess. 

It was the worst phase of my life. I was in pain, both physical and mental. 

Physical pain because of a neurological problem I had been suffering from for the past five years - a pain that wouldn't let me get a sound sleep. And who doesn't know that alcohol acts as a painkiller. 

What made it worse were my strained relationship with my parents and the uncertainty of future. I had just quit my engineering career - a career that I wasn't interested in in the first place, a career that was imposed upon me by my parents. 

I was a 25 year old limping guy with no job, money, friends, or family. I didn't know what to do. Alcohol was the easiest escape route for me.

So, why am I writing all these? 

I don't know. I think it's a story worth sharing. But more than that, I need to face the worst phase of my life, I need to take the responsibility of it, and I need to remind myself not to go back to drinking. 

I hope I don't go back to drinking ever again.
