I thought Kunal Kamra, the comedian known for, among other things, mocking the Modi government, hated the *chaddis*.

Then why was he so nice with the head of Godi Media?

I mean which sane person would miss such an opportunity to bash Doorknob Guswami left, right and center?

Nationalist and Coward - these two words don't describe even 1 percent of what Guswami really is...

If it were up to me to convey the same thing that Kunal did, I would probably have said:

> If you ever get a chance to pull your head out of Modi's a#@, if you ever take a break from sucking his d*@#, try reading Rohit Vemula's suicide note...
