When I was growing up, no body was so obsessed with their religious identity. At least, none from my generation.

We were not taught to be atheist. But we were not taught to hate others in the name of religion either.

I wonder how these same kids, when all grown up, became such religious fanatics. I wonder where all this hatred came from. I wonder from where they learned to wear their religion on their sleeve.

It amazes me to see these people I used to consider my friend once upon a time, with tilaks on their forehead, yelling on top of their voices â€˜Jay Sri Raamâ€™ and spewing venom from their lips.

The ones at the receiving end have their own share of fanaticism to exhibit - skullcaps and burqa right from their childhood.

We are living in the time of absolute bigotry and zealotry.

And so, when I saw two young girls walking down street holding hands and chatting, one in a burqa, the other in shorts revealing her beautiful legs, I couldnâ€™t help but smileâ€¦

I guess there is still hopeâ€¦ I hope there isâ€¦ ðŸ˜Š
