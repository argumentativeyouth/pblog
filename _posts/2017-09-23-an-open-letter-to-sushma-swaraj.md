Dear Sushma Swaraj,

While Pakistan created Lashkar and Jaish-e-Mohammad, you created Gau Rakshaks and Anti-Romeo Squad. Not to forger that your RSS is infamous for creating havoc on a regular basis.

You and your ideology killed the likes of Kalburgi, Pansare, Dabholkar, and Gauri Lankesh.

It is because of you 1992 and 2002 happened.

It is unfortunate that you cannot boast of these contributions of yours on an international platform, something your party members proudly justify.

It is unfortunate that you have to show the report card of other governments that has run the country.

It is unfortunate that you have to talk about IITs and IIMs on international platforms, which were set up in the 67 years of Indian Independence. And at the same time, you say nothing happened in those 67 years.

Yes, Pakistan has contributed to global terrorism but you are no better.

Sushma ji, had you been in power for those 67 years, India would have been another Pakistan, maybe worse than that.

It is because of you, common Indians live in fear in their own country.

You are the greatest internal threat India has ever had.
