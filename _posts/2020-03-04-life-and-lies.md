— Ansel Adams

One of the many things that I miss doing is roaming around in the streets of Bangalore and taking photographs of the most insignificant aspects of life and lies.

Photography, to me, comes after writing and sketching. Probably that's why, I lost touch with it when the other practicalities of life engulfed me. My DSLR, Canon 700D, is now gathering dust on it.

But I do respect and appreciate the power of photography in storytelling.

Anyway, the other day at work, I was chatting and kidding around with some of the new kids who joined my team. I spend a lot of time trying to know every new joinee - what they like to do, what kind of movies they watch, what are their hobbies, if they prefer coffee to tea or chicken to mutton, and even things like if they watched Shaktiman. I also tell them about myself. 

That day I told them that they were like zombies. Too boring and lifeless. 

One of the girls who had already started following me on Instagram replied, "When was the last time you took a photograph? Or made a sketch?"

"Months back..."

"And we are zombies?" 

I thought and realized that probably I too am turning into a zombie. But it's also true that I enjoy, in fact, I am kind of addicted to the things that keep me busy at work these days. 

Anyway, I am on leave and this has given me the opportunity to go through some of the old and dilapidated folders in my hard drive. I came across some of the last photographs I took. Here they are:
