The phone beeped. 

It was a message on LinkedIn. I barely go to LinkedIn unless prompted like this. I have not even updated my LinkedIn profile for a very long time.

Anyway, I clicked on the notification to check who it was. 

>Hi, I just happened to go through your LinkedIn profile and impressed with your skill set. We have an exciting opportunity for you at India's No1 ED-Tech company based out of Bengaluru. Let's connect to discuss.

It was a recruiter. Since Embibe is expanding and we are hiring a lot, I thought it was for our company. And so, I replied:

> Hello, I think this message was sent to me by mistake. I am already working with India's No. 1 Ed-Tech company. :) 

The person replied next day: 

> Thanks For Connecting PFA JD For the role. If this interests you share me your resume with below details filled.

> 1) Current CTC,
> 2) Expected CTC,
> 3) Notice period...

I understood that the person didn't even bother to read my response.  Anyway, I opened the doc file. Apparently, India's No. 1 Ed-Tech company is Byju's.

Now that I knew it was for Byju's, the response of that person made sense. When I had just joined Embibe as an intern to handle Quora, I did a lot of research to understand the industry. This research involved understanding not only our own products but also what our competitors were offering. In order to do that, there were times when I interacted with the support team of other Ed-Tech companies, including Byju's. Of all those companies, the responese of Byju's, every single time, exhibited heights of desparation. I asked them tons of questions but the only thing they cared about was my email ID and phone number. 

**Q:** What is adaptive learning?

**A:** I will definitely help you out. Please share your email ID and phone number.

**Q:** When is CAT notification coming out?

**A:** I will definitely help you out. Please share your email ID and phone number. 

**Q:** Hey, buddy. You had lunch?

**A:** I will definitely...

Ok, the last one was a joke. But I am not making it up when I say that they are too desparate to make a sale.

So, I remembered all these the moment I saw Byju's logo on the doc file shared by that recruiter.

And I remembered my initial days at Embibe when we were a small team of 40-50 and every one had to wear many hats. For example, every one from the Content Marketing team used to take chats for a couple of hours every day. 

Just a month or so after I had joined, one morning while I was on chat, a guy messaged. Despite studying hard for two long years, he couldn't clear a certain exam. He was so depressed and wanted some guidance on what he should do now. At one point, he even said he felt like committing suicide. 

When I told my boss about it, she told me to continue talking to the guy, assure him that everything was going to be fine, and make sure he felt better. 

I chatted with him for the next three hours. Not to tell him to prepare for the exam again, not to convince him to purchase our product for his preparation. But to make him understand that clearing or not clearing an exam is not the end of the world. To tell him that it's OK if he doesn't become an engineer or a doctor. My boss made sure I was empathetic and understanding.

And over the next two and half years, I saw this empathetic side of this company multiple times.

Another time, just after the results of a particular exam was declared and we were making calls to our students. It was 11 at night. Every body was dead tired. But we had to finish making the calls and get data for our Success Stories.

This guy who did extremely well in his mock tests failed to clear the actual exam. He refused to talk to anyone. There wasn't any 'Success Story' here and yet my CEO picked up the phone and spoke with him for almost 45 minutes. 

Being empathetically strong
