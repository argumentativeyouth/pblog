Isn't it irritating when a conversation reaches the 'Aur Batao' point: when you don't have anything else to say or ask, and you impose it upon the other person to continue the conversation?

When I run out of words, I just shut up myself no matter how awkward it seems... I am bad at conversation and I know it; I don't try to make it interesting forcefully asking 'Aur Batao'... I know it's irritating for the other person too.

But if given a chance, I will happily ask 'Aur Batao' to three people all through the day and night: Anupam Kher, Chetan Bhagat, and singer Abhijit... :D

For I am sure they will never ever get irritated. In fact, they will open their potty mouth every time, and come up with something that will make you roll on the floor laughing... :P

Even if you ROFL, get up, and ask again, "Aur Batao", they won't get it... :D

That's what they do on Twitter no matter how much you troll them :P

I wish I could interview the three of them together
