So after three long months, today my mom asked me again what I plan to do with my life... As if I know :/

It seemed like she was neither fully happy with what I do nor confident about my 'ability' to think about my future.

"I haven't thought of it yet," I said. "But I do know what I don't want to do..."

"When will you grow up? You should be serious about your life and career," she said anxiously.

"Are you worried about whether or not I will be successful?"

"I am...," she accepted.

"Maa, do you remember as a kid I used to learn and practice magic tricks for hours?"

"Yes, I do. You were good at it and I was happy because you used to spend most of your time in your room and I didn't have to worry about you going out to play and come back home with a broken hand..."

"That's so selfish. You didn't want me to play outdoor and keep my body fit?"

"Shut up... Tell me, do you still practice magic? That's OK. But are you now planning to become a magician? Oh god...!" She panicked.

"Chill, Maa... I just wanted to ask how would you react if I am in a saffron dhoti and I turn currency notes into dust and then turn it back into notes? Like one of your favourite godman said?"

"I would know that it's a trick..."

"What if I was a stranger in saffron, not your son?"

She didn't say anything. She is an admirer of many godmen.

"Maa, you don't have to worry about my future. If not anything, I will become a godman and earn in crores. I also remember around 100 Sanskrit slokas. Check out my marksheet of Class 8. I got 98 in Sanskrit. And if you are OK with Swami "X" Nanda "Y"Nanda, you should be OK with me becoming Pritamananda too... a godman...I have all the eligibility criteria."

She started laughing. "You would actually do good if you become a godman," she said.

I felt happy for a moment. But then she said, "But you shouldn't be making fun of all these things..."

:(
