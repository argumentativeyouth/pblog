There is no denying the fact that we are witnessing a phase when India is rapidly being saffronized. The results of the recently held UP Assembly Election are testimonial to it. The Hindu nationalists are, indeed, on the rise. What makes it more disturbing is that the Sangh Parivaar is on the rise despite making headlines so frequently for the wrong reasons.

 

Has there been even a single week since May 2014, when the BJP came to power, during which the Modi Government, the Prime Minister, his Cabinet, other BJP members, the RSS, the VHP, the ABVP, and of course, the Bhakts were not mocked and criticised for their stupidity, selfishness, hyper-nationalism, dictatorial attitudes?

 

Here is a list of 78 such issues/events, some of which have occurred multiple times, that brought the Modi government into controversy:

 

1. **Appointment of Smriti Irani as HRD Minister:** A 2014 affidavit filed with the Election Commission showed that Smriti Irani is a college dropout who had only completed the first year of her bachelor’s degree in commerce through correspondence from Delhi University.

2. **Appointment of many Cabinet Ministers who had faced various charges of corruption:** According to a report , 31 percent of the Council of Ministers had declared criminal cases against themselves, 17 percent facing serious criminal cases.

 

3. **Imposition of Hindi:**  Remember the circular the government had issued asking all Ministries and Departments, public sector undertakings and banks to give prominence to Hindi on official accounts?

 

4. **Asking the “Congress-appointed” Governors of states to quit:** And appointment of BJP stooges as new Governors.

 

5. **Appointment of Gajendra Chauhan as Chairman of FTII:** Who can ever forget the FTII Row ?

7. **Film censorships:** The latest one being censored was Lipstick Under My Burkha.

 

8. **Rewriting history:** Hey, don’t you forget that Dinanath Batra’s books were prescribed by the Gujarat Government and Nehru was removed from Rajasthan school books 

 

9. **German language row:** Sanskrit over German: Yes, it was Smriti Irani’s HRD ministry that decided to replace German with Sanskrit as a third language in Kendriya Vidyalaya schools 

 

10. **Boasting off of Vedic Vigyan:** Remember the introduction of Pushpak Vimaan at Indian Science Congress.

 

11. **Ganesha and his plastic Surgery:** The Prime Minister said that Lord Ganesha, the elephant-headed Hindu god was the result of plastic surgery. That’s what happens when you read Batra’s books.

 

12. **Ban on India’s Daughter:** How can we let the world know that ours is a society where rape victims and not the rapist are blamed for rape?

16. **And in Haryana too:** By the way, Haryana is infamous for its Khap Panchayats and misogynist attitude; women are bartered in this state. and the sex ratio is far below the national average. And the BJP government’s priority is, however, to save the GauMaata.

 

17. **Dadri lynching:** A Hindu mob lynched a Muslim man, who the mob suspected of slaughtering a stolen ‘sacred’ cow calf. A BJP leader’s son was named among the 15 accused. And when one of the accused died in jail, his body arrived home draped in Tiranga.
