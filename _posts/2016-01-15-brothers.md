The old woman,
Before she died,
Never asked for anything,
Like they show in those black and white movies.

She never asked for forgiveness,
Or love,
Nor did she ask about the man
She wasn't supposed to love,
And yet she did... Her extramarital affair.

And they stood there, the two men,
Without uttering a word,
They didn't feel the need for anger
Or blame,
Nor did they shed a single drop of tear...

"Tell me, what is your problem?
Who else would you share your problems with,
If not with me?"
The younger man remembered the older man
Asking him this question
Once upon a time before they stopped talking...

And the older man remembered
How the younger one had told him
That he was a bastard
And that he hated him...

And yet,
There they stood,
Their shadows cast on the flowers,
On the grave of the old woman
They both loved and hated...

And they both wished
The evening light played some game,
And their shadows were united...
