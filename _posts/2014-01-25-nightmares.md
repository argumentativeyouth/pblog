*You have eyes*

*And you close them*

*To drift into another land,*

*A land, they say, where*

*Everything comes true,*

*The good and the bad things, yes both.*

*But you think of the bad things*

*And it scares you*

*To fall asleep*

*As if he will come*

*And tie your hands*

*And legs,*

*And rip apart your heart*

*And genital.*

*As if he will beat you*

*To death*

*And you forget*

*That the truth is:*

*Knife stabs you one day*

*And the next day*

*You stab it.*

*'Do I get hurt?' you think,*

*'No', I say, 'You do not.'*

*Because it gets blunt*

*And because it snows*

*Inside your head.*

*So have some sleep tonight.*

*Nightmares are just nightmares.*

*Reality is far more scary*

*And you live with it.*

*Then why not live in dreams?*
