Dear Maa,

That Ruksar would come alive some days isn’t something you liked… You will be happy to know that nowadays she doesn’t…

Probably because I am honestly, madly, insanely, hopelessly, desperately, rudely, sanctimoniously, proudly, happily and miserably, at the same time, unapologetically in love with someone else…

Yes, there is always someone else to fill up the void left by a person…
