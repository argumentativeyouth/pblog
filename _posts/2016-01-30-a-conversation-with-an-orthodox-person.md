Having a conversation with an orthodox person is so much fun sometimes...

**Me:** Marriage is stupid. The burden of unnecessary associated relationships that comes with marriage makes it miserable. I love my girlfriend with all my heart, and I want her in my life. I don't want her entire family, although I won't deny the perks of having a few beautiful sisters-in-law... But that's second in my priority list.

**Orthodox Person (OP):** Noooooo. Everyone should take responsibilities...

**Me:** Responsibilities become a burden if it's imposed upon you. You can't give your hundred percent. I will happily do what needs to be done for her parents; doesn't matter if she is my wife or not...

**OP:** I don't want a boyfriend like that...

**Me:** You know why the five (exaggerated to irritate her) relationships I had been into before I met Pallabi didn't work? Because of this... More than being in the moment they were busy making plans about what to expect from me in the future... When I was trying to woo Pallabi, the first thing she said was "I don't believe in marriage... I don't believe in making plans" and I was like "I love You more than I used to few minutes back..." It, of course, depends on the two persons involved, but that's their bad. If they make plans like that, they are impractical and idiots...

**OP:** What if your girlfriend says that? That she had been with other guys before she met you? How would you feel?

**Me:** Oh, she had been into three- four (exaggerated again) relationships before she met me...

**OP:** Aiyoooooo...

And she runs away... Literally runs for her life...
