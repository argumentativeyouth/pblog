The chatbox beeped.

**He:** Hey, I want to wear the scariest costume ever this Halloween. Give me some ideas.

**Me:** Dress up like a smart, confident, well-read, politically aware, ambitious woman. In a male dominated world, everybody is scared of them.

**He:** Come on! Seriously, man. Please give me some really good ideas...

**Me:** I am serious! But I am not sure how to LOOK like a smart, confident, well-read, politically aware, ambitious woman. I mean, of course, I can give you some ideas. But that would be stereotyping.

**He:** Man...

**Me:** Actually, even if you do make ups and look like a Vampire, it would be stereotyping Vampires... What if there were Vampires who do not look like the way we know Vampires?

**He:** OK... You have to kill the fun out of everything... Bye.

**Me:** No no. Listen. Trust me, a "smart, confident, well-read, politically aware, ambitious woman" would be the scariest of all... And they are real too, unlike Vampires and Zombies... All you have to do is wear a woman's costume and act smart, confident, well-read, and bla bla bla...

**He:** Fuck you...

**Me:** Sorry. I had forgotten that you CAN'T ACT smart and confident, well-read and politically aware... You have to be that way... Ok, let me come up with another idea...

But before I could come up with another idea, he blocked me.
