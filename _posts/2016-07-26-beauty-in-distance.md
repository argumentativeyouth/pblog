I love women. I fall in love everyday (thanks to Facebook).

But I don’t bother them at all. I barely send “Hi-Hello” kind of messages to them. And whenever I do, it is mostly to seek their permission to make a sketch. And most of the time, I take literally months before I ask them if I could make their sketches.

So yeah, I am “very slow” with women, like my girlfriend says. And she thinks that it is because I am lazy. Womanizing isn’t my first priority, but it is one of them, she says. Apparently, that’s why I just romance with them from a distance, without uttering a word.

I just hit like on their profile pictures (which my girlfriend notices), and I have imaginary conversation with them (which my girlfriend believes).


Anyway, my romances do not last long (not that I start hating them after its over; I just lose track of them, they are innumerable). Once I make their sketches, I forget them. And the ones I don’t get the opportunity to seek their permission, they make me forget them… 😀

Like by asking me to sketch them. That too in this language :

“yr… can u drw mah pic? “

Call me a spelling Nazi or whatever. But SMS language pisses me off. This is one of the many ways I get disappointed with this world. You get pissed off when your name is spelt or pronounced wrongly, but find it absolutely OK to text in SMS language, fucking every single word of a language. And what do you do with the time you save?

Nah , I don’t text people, even women I have crush on, not because I am lazy, but because I know most of them will disappoint me. If not with their SMS language, then with something else…

There is a certain kind of beauty in distance…
