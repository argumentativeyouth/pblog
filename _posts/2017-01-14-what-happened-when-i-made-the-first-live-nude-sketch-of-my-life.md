It happened almost four years ago...

I got my first model, a girl who was ready to pose nude for me to make a live sketch...

Even though my girlfriend had always been OK with my obsession with nude sketches and my ambition to make this sort of sketches live, a part of me thought that it would be better not to tell her, my girlfriend, about it...

So I just asked my model, who's an old friend, to come over to my place... (Let's call her Anindita).

Anyway, Anindita came to my place... She undressed herself in no time.

"What expression do you want from me?"

I was about to make the first live nude sketch in my life... I was tensed for obvious reasons. And at the same time, a part of me was feeling guilty, for I didn't tell my girlfriend about it. And the other part, honestly speaking, was excited, for a nude girl was standing in front of me...

The artist in me had gone into hibernation, and it took me a while to tell her what expression she should give...

"Pretend as if you are trying to seduce me," I said after one long minute...

And she lay herself down on the bed, and made seductive gestures...

I stood over her, my feet on the two sides of her waist, and started making her sketch...

"You are on top of me, and yet so far away..." Anindita giggled. She was saying things like this continuously. She wasn't just giving seductive expressions; she was also seducing me with her words... I was turned on (thank goodness I had my underwear), but I ignored her and continued with the sketch...

I was almost done with the sketch when I heard some sound at the front door...

It was my girlfriend.

She had come over to my place with food, since I was broke and didn't have anything since the previous night... She had a spare key to my flat...

I freaked out...

My girlfriend entered, saw me (with my sketchbook) standing over a nude girl...

And she said, "Let me know when you are done... Will make coffee..."

Somehow I finished the sketch.

My girl made coffee for the three of us, and we chatted... Actually the two of them chatted. I was freaking out...

"You sure want to keep going out with this guy? I tried to seduce him, but he didnâ€™t react at all... I hope his machineries are working," Anindita actually said that to my girl...

She, my girl just laughed...

They chatted for sometime and then Anindita left...

"Show me the sketch..." my girl asked after Anindita left.

I showed her the sketch, and she said, "This is the worst sketch you have ever made... I don't blame you... You were turned on..."

That's all she had to say...

And even after all these years, whenever we talk about that day, the only thing she does is burst out laughing...

Yes, we are so meant for each other...
