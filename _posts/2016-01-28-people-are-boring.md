"You have gone absolutely bonkers..."

"Why?"

"The minimum of sweetness in you is gone..."

"I don't get you...I am sweet to you."

"Stop pretending. You know what I am talking about. Being sweet to me isn't enough. In fact, I wonder if it's real..."

"I have no idea what you are talking about..."

"You have become too much straight forward. You do not give a damn about who you are speaking to... "

"Why? What did I do?"

"Ask yourself..."

"I don't know..."

"You are literally telling everyone that they are boring... Also you are testing people. You really didn't have to tell that girl that her new hair style looked ugly as shit to see the sincerity in her willingness to know how it really looked like... Also I remember you telling your teacher that you were making a sketch in her class because it was boring... "

"Why wouldn't I? People are boring... And that's because they are lazy... Had it not been so, today would have been a different day. But it was same as yesterday, and the day before, and the day before. Laziness is a vice. So..."

"Stop bullshitting... "

"Why? Because you are a workaholic? And it offends you? You do the same stuffs everyday...Being a workaholic means nothing if you can't come up with new ideas... "

"Fuck you... I don't feel offended. I worry about you..."

"Why? What's there to worry about me?"

"You are repelling people in the process of making your life interesting..."

"I am repelling people in the process of not making my life dull... I am damn interesting..."

"You are, you are... The fact that you love a bitch like me makes you interesting..."

"But you just said that you doubt my being sweet to you..."

"I do... But I don't doubt that you love me. Why do you love me?"

"Because you are a bitch. And bitch is the new goddess..."

"Tell me something... Are you a misogynist?"

"Why?"

"It's not because you agree that I am a bitch..."

"Then?"

"I don't know... Probably because of the way you go out of your way to drive away women... And then you make their nude sketches..."

"I drive away men and women equally. That they bore the shit out of me has nothing to do with their sex. But because I am straight, and I love confident and unapologetic women, I find nude women interesting..."

"Damn! Your honesty is...interesting..."

"I know I am interesting..."

"But is people's laziness the only reason you hate them?"

"I don't hate them... I just don't like them around me."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"It means 'live and let live'..."

"So complicated... Anyway, do you find me interesting?"

"Yes... And that's because I love you. Probably that's why I still wonder why you like a particular song or a book... I still insist you to tell me why you are feeling low... Or overexcited... I still try to understand the motive behind everything you do... Even if you cook fish, something you don't like... "

"So sweet..."

"Sometimes the Twilight Saga makes sense, doesn't it? Edward could never read Bella's mind..."

"We were having a nice conversation... Why did you have to do it?"
