I have got thirty bucks in my pocket right now.

I am the poor guy who goes to salon once in two months to save money, and when my girl asks me why I am not getting a hair cut, I say, "I want to look like The Beatles" and then I sing P.S. I Love You... She smiles, a sad smile... I will never ever forget that smile.

I am the one who says that I have had Chicken Biriyani when my parents ask what I had for lunch. The truth is I have had Roti-Sabji... I don't want my parents to feel bad about it. I want them to have a peaceful sleep. (Thank goodness I don't have them in my friend list)

I am the one who goes to the book shop, likes a book, looks at the price, then keep it back in the shelf. I come back home, look for the book in flipkart or amazon, the price still not affordable... I save them in my wish list... And yes, I will buy them someday...

I think about all the people who don't even have thirty bucks and are starving tonight. I feel good about myself.

The chatbox beeps. It's a friend.

"Whatsup?" she asks.

We talk and I tell her everything. Yeah, I never lie to my friends...

"What will you eat tonight? Let me order something online then. I will pay for you. What do you want to eat?" she says.

I smile.

Another friend texts. He asks me to go to his place. Seems he is making kababs.

Both are facebook friends.

I smile and tell them my girl has arranged for my dinner. Yeah, she is in Silchar, I am in Bangalore. But she did it. She is mad and magic, you see...

The female friend says, "Yeah, I want you to eat something for your girl only. She loves you so much. You can't afford to die."

The guy says, "Cool bro! Should I join you then? We can have the Kebabs tomorrow..."

I smile. I have got thirty bucks in my pocket. But I don't feel poor anymore...
