**Question:** How to kill Gandhi?

**Answer:** 
**Attempt 1:** Kill the man, like in the truest sense of the word...

**Result:** Operation_to kill_the_person_successful. But it didn't do any good to us (the Sanghis). People still remember him and his ideologies...

**Attempt 2:** Make Godse more popular... Celebrate him... People might forget Gandhi then... Afterall 1) Godse killed Gandhi, and 2) People are idiots, they go with the flow...

**Result:** Operation back-fired... Seems like Gandhi is still very much alive even after all these years.

**Attempt 3:** Replace Gandhi by Modi (the mass murderer leader of the party who killed Gandhi) in government controlled Khadi agency's diary and calendar.

**Result:** It's failing too... come on it's too stupid an idea... Gandhi will still live...

**Expected Attempt 4:** Since we are still in the process of printing new notes (thanks to #demonitization), let's replace Gandhi's face by Modi's face on the notes...

**Result:** Khikhikhi, people are using the notes but Gandhi is still alive...

***P.S. Not a fan of Gandhi. But I kind of like him... And he is definitely more appealing an idea than the likes of Savarkar... You can't kill Gandhi just by killing the man. Also by making stupid attempts to kill Gandhi's ideology, you are weakening your position... Come up with something intelligent, you morons, for a change... And even if you do, Gandhi will still live...***
