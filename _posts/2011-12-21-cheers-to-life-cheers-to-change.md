I still remember those days when I was not allowed to watch English movies, when censor board (my parents) used to put a bann
on everything I used to get attracted to, when watching MTV, FTV were like midnight adventures, when the thought of kissing
someone other than Maa was like a sin, when words like "asshole" were not in my dictionary and 'middle finger' didn't exist, when drinks
meant Frooti and Pepsi, and *yeh dil maange more* was not for alcohol, when chocolates were the best medicine, when tears meant being
beaten by dad, fear meant being scolded my Maa, when punishments were just 'kneel down' and 'get out of the class', when a black eye
was just for cheating scores in a cricket match, when betraying was when my best friend not sharing his lunch with me, when pocket money
was 5 Rupees a day, when happiness was in friends wishing Happy Birthday, when confidence was *Hum Kaale Hai To Kya Hua Dilwale Hai*, when being fearless was not doing homeworks...

Love was like a dream then where I was SRK and the girl, whom I could never propose was Kajol, when my side pillow used to give proxy for her in my life,
when her slightest touch while taking a pen used to be a 6000V electric shock, when staring at her was the most illegal thing possible...

Life now has changed a lot. No one cares if I watch porn. I have lost all my fingers except the middle one. Drinks mean swimming in
Signature. Tears are for the colorful past. And fear is for the future. Punishments are "Get the hell out of my life". And happiness means an SMS after
a terrible fight - "Come Back..I can't live without you..." Confidence means being appreciated by Maa, dad, teachers, and friends... which is a rare case
now..

Even love changes its color..

She says its not love that I feel for her...
She says it's obsession... It's a relationship between a host and a parasite... She says...

And yet, she doesn't leave me... Neither do I...

We fight, we utter slangs for each other, she cries... and then she says she loves me... and everything is alright...

Life is beautiful..and I love it... even though some changes are not acceptable. But then again change is the only constant and it kills the monotony of life... So, cheers to life, cheers to change!

**P.S.:** I am not a supporter of frequent girlfriend/boyfriend change...
