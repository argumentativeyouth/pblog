So yesterday, my mom and I exchanged our recent photos with each other after a long time...

Since I do not like the other members of my family, I do not entertain video chats and all, for there are chances that they will peek while I am video chatting with Maa...

So sharing photos over Whatsapp is the only way we get to see each other...And that too we barely do...

Anyway, while she was quite happy with my healthy look, I was sad...

My mom has become so thin... She looks so old...

And I felt guilty... For I know she misses me... We haven't met for two years. And she worries about me all the time...

For a moment, I thought if it was worth it...

That I left my family, the engineering career, my friends, my hometown, and MY MOM for this dream course I am pursuing... Even though I am doing well in this course, and I am almost done with it, I was doubting myself, the choices I had made...

But the feeling didn't last long...

It was definitely worth it...

And I know someday, she will be proud of me...

For the Goldfish in me doesn't circle round and round inside a tiny fish bowl anymore... And that's what my mom wanted me to become...

More importantly, that's what I have always wanted to become...

But yes, I will go home once this course gets over, which means three more months... She needs a big hug from me... And I know everything will be alright after that...
