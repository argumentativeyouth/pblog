No, I am not at all a fan of Karan Johar...

And considering the kind of films he makes, I have never expected much from him...

To me he is just as common a person as any of us...

Just because he is a filmmaker doesn't make any difference...

Just because he is filthy rich and has a so-called "respectable" position in Bollywood doesn't mean he will make any difference...

I don't expect him to be a revolutionary film-maker...to be someone who would stand for some serious issues...

And so, I feel #KaranJohar's #comingout, that is trending on social media, isn't something that should be criticised...

Considering the kind of movies he makes, his so-called "cowardly" coming out wasn't actually cowardly at all...

In fact, he should be celebrated... at last...
