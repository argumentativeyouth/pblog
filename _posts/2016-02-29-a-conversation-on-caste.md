title: A Conversation On Caste

**The owner of my flat:** I am totally against reservation. We don't need reservations in this 21st century...

**Me:** Says the guy who asked my caste before 'accepting' me as a tenant... Khikhikhi...

Thank goodness, I have a friendly relationship with him. 

Otherwise, he would probably have asked me to pay the rent on the last week of the month from now... 

Anyway, he just pretended that he had a phone call to attend...
