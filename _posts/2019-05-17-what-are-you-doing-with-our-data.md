Back in my final year at journalism school, in early 2017, I remember we were furious at Cambridge Analytica’s role in the US Presidential Elections. And more than that, we were frustrated with where science and technology was leading us to.

In the postpost-truth era, a bunch of wannabe journalists, powered by an extreme sense of ethics and morality, found themselves on the verge of denouncing Science.

The rise of another tech-savvy, right wing fundamentalist political party in our own country made it even more frustrating for us.

Many of us denounced social media. We didn’t want anybody to use our data to manipulate us. After the 2014 elections, we were like once bitten twice shy.

Two years later, here I am working happily in an organization which is thriving, thanks to the power of data analysis.

Unbelievable, right?

I should be ashamed of myself.

But I am not.

I joined this company soon after graduating. At that time, I didn’t know what I was getting into. I didn’t even know that data analysis was in the heart of the company.

I just needed a job to pay my bills. I thought I would be looking for openings at news organizations and would put down my papers in this company the moment I get a job in one of them.

But like everything else, things didn’t work the way I had planned. I got too much involved in what this company was doing. And it changed my way of thinking…

You see, it’s an AI-powered edtech. It collects data from lakhs of students who practice and take tests on the platform. The analysis of this huge data helps us understand the students better; we know where exactly most of the students are likely to make mistakes.

In fact, the algorithm can identify the strengths and weaknesses of individual students, and predict where they are likely to lose marks in the exam. Based on these, the AI-powered tool that we have created provides personalized guidance to the students, so that they don’t make these mistakes in the exam.

Basically, we help students reach their fullest potential by identifying the gaps in their knowledge and behavior, and providing the exact guidance that they need.

This is a revolution in itself. I mean, imagine the impact this technology can have in places where teacher to students ratio is extremely low.

It didn’t take much time for me to be aligned with the company’s vision. And I also realized how stupid it was to be frustrated with the advancement of science and technology.

It feels great that I didn’t end up in one of those fake pillars of democracy. It feels great to be part of something which is really making a difference.

And I feel privileged to be a part of this organization.
