We all come across a certain phase of life when even the best teacher can't teach us the simplest of all things...

Still 16-19 years is the most beautiful age in the life of a guy -a stage when you have all the confidence of the world...

You get less marks in exam and yet you don't care, instead you care about whether someone is bothering your girl and if
so, you don't think twice before getting into a fight with that person. 

Breaking rules is the most macho thing possible
to you. You start riding bike and you don't bother about the red light at the traffic signal. 

You fight with your little sister
(who's watching cartoon) for the remote, to watch FTV. 

You watch pornographic movies when nobody's at home. You utter slang..

You start smoking... secretly in the terrace...

You bunk tutions, sometimes school and go for cricket matches with your friends
who apparently become your family.

You get your first cellphone and insomnia starts dwelling in your life, 100s of SMS filling
up your inbox every night...

You start lying to your parents...

And you believe in every moves of those who share the dance floor
with you...

You kiss for the first time...

You believe only you know, understand and feel everything and these are the ultimate truths... You feel there's no one else in this
world who understands you. And still life is beautiful... everyday full of incidents...

And then, one day, not all of a sudden though, happy days come to an end. Complications set in. And it feels hard to accept
the changes, the real realities. You wish you were numb, deaf and dumb. Teen age life ends with an unspeakable secret,
irreversible regret, unforgtable love and unbelieveable goodbyes..

Stepping into the new world, you ask yourself - How does it feel like to not feel anything???

You don't get any answer..

And you choose to grow up...
