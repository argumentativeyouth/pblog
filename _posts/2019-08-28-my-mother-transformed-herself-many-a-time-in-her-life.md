*My mother transformed herself many a time in her life.*

*I do not like changes.*

*Changes,  I find, are difficult to cope with.*

*So, eventually,  I developed a certain kind of aversion towards her.*


*This, she didn’t like, I guess.*

*Of course, she never told me*

*But then again mothers barely say anything.*

*They just shrink with all the words within them*

*And cease to exist one fine day.*


*I wonder what happens to the unsaid words.*

*Do they fly with the ashes?*

*Or mix with the ground?*


*My mother transformed herself many a time in her life.*

*But I never bothered to find out*

*What brought about all these transformations.*

*And I wasn’t aware of how it started.*


*Years later, I saw another woman change.*

*This time I asked and she said it was needed.*


*“I was comfortable running around in shorts,” she said,*

*“But my mother asked me to cover my body.*

*Because it was indecent to run*

*And to show my body.*

*I had to change myself.*


*“Then when I was married off to a man*

*And had to move with him to a new city,*

*Thousands of miles away from my family,*

*To live with his,*

*I had to leave behind*

*A part of my shame and decency – I had to learn to fight,*

*For once married, every woman is on her own.*


*“And just when I was getting comfortable with my fierce avatar,*

*I had to “calm myself down”*

*For a fierce mother is not good for the child.”*



*All these times,*

*The man remained the same, she said.*

*“They can afford not to change themselves.”*


*And I wondered what were my mother’s reasons for all these changes.*


*My mother transformed herself many a time in her life,*

*But I never cared to know the reasons.*

*'Guess I will never know.*
