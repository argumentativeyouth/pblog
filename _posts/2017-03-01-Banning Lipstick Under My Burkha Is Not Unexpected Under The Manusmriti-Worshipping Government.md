title: Banning Lipstick Under My Burkha Is Not Unexpected Under The Manusmriti-Worshipping Government

The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) is making the headlines again for all the wrong reasons as it refuses to certify the film Lipstick Under My Burkha, thus blocking its release. The film, directed by Alankrita Shrivastava and produced by Prakash Jha, was denied certification, because, as the CBFC said in its statement, “The story is lady-oriented, their fantasy above life. There are contanious sexual scenes, abusive words, audio pornography and a bit sensitive touch about one particular section of society, hence film refused under guidelines.”

 

This is not just an assault on women’s right and freedom of expression. It also implies that any attempt to change the status quo of the society as well as of Hindi film industry will be suppressed. The dominant narrative in Hindi films has mostly propagated patriarchy and has portrayed women from the perspective of men. Women roles have mostly been insignificant, at least less significant than their male counterparts.

 

Lipstick Under My Burkha, on the other hand, attacks this patriarchal popular narrative, and breaks the stereotypes associated with Indian women. The film depicts women nurturing sexual (among other) desires and needs, which is an alien idea in the patriarchal Indian society. Thus, by not certifying the film, the CBFC has given a clear message: no attempt to attack the Bharatiya Sanskriti, no matter how age-old beliefs it has, will be entertained.

 

However, what makes this entire episode seem to be more hypocritical is that the decision to not issue certificate for the film comes from someone like Pahlaj Nihalani, the present CBFC chief. Nihalani, in his days as a Bollywood producer and director, made C-grade movies filled with sexism, violence, and cheapness of the highest order.

His only qualification for the post he is holding is that he made Modi- supporting videos – Har Ghar Modi and Mera Desh Hai Mahaan.  These two videos made by him got him the post he is holding- the chief of Central Board of Film Certification. And the same government, which too is obsessed with Bharatiya Sanskriti, also appointed Gajendra Chauhan, the actor who played a lecher in Khuli Khidki, a soft-porn.

 

And that’s why, the ban on Lipstick Under My Burkha by Pahlaj Nihalani-led CBFC is actually not hypocritical from his part at all.

 

Nihalani is a BJP stooge. He has been a BJP supporter, unapologetically. And the BJP is a Manusmriti-worshipping, misogynist Hindu nationalist party in power.
