title: Picture Quality Back In Those Days Was Not Good

Well, back again after an embarassing day..

I was watching porn in the morning. I was feeling chiggy wiggy. And since I am at home, surrounded by my parents 24x7, who are
no less than Scotland Yard cops, keeping an watch on their jobless son, what he's doing, whom he's texting, whether he's making
plans to run away from here (trust me, they really think so; the situation is kind of like that, but that's a different story);
it's impossible to do some reat stuffs..So, blue films..

Now, the ear-phone I use is loose and doesn't get connected with my lappy properly. I mean sometimes it betrays me, like it
did today. When it's not connected properly, the sound still comes from the earphone's speaker and also from the laptop's
speaker. And that's what happened today.

And since my ears were stuffed with earphones, I couldn't hear the sound from the other source. And yeah,you are right. 
What happened next was dad heard that sound and came to my room suddenly. And since I was not expecting
him, I jumped up, the earphone fell down from my ears, and I discovered what has drawn him here...

And he discovered what I was watching...

All day, I couldn't speak properly with him, couldn't look straight into his eyes. He too didn't say anything.
It was a different sort of day. We didn't even fight today, which happens on a regular basis nowadays.

I was avoiding to come face-to-face with him...

And he was annoyed... He loves to talk alot... even if it is argumentative..

So, at last he came to my room and said, "You know what? Picture quality back in our days was not so great..."

P.S.: I think he was happy cause I was doing something else, and not facebook..
