What if my whole life has been a hallucination?

What if one morning I wake up to see that I am on my way to my government job with a 'dabba' in my hand?

What if I come back home in the evening after a boring day with boring people who mocked me all day for being an idiot, and stand in my balcony to find that Pallabi is actually my neighbour's wife?

What if I discover that I am still a man with lots of personality issues, a person who even though hates many of the societal rules, does not have the guts to fight, and has surrendered himself to the evil society?

What if I have Patanjali noodles for my dinner, and then put oil my mom bought for me from another Baba, in my head and go to sleep?

What if I am a Modi Bhakt? :O

So imaginative :D

Or probably I am confusing my insanity with imaginations...
