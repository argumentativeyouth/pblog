*I look at the old, fading photograph of my grandpa,*

*Hanging from the wall.*

*He is sitting on a huge chair,*

*His left arm looks a bit odd, unusual,*

*It's slightly hanging in the air for no reason,*

*As if he is holding something.*

*But there is nothing.*


*I remember the day this photo was taken.*

*It was his last day at work*

*And the photo was taken in his office after the farewell party.*


*I was there.*

*I mean I was there in the photo.*

*It was me, his favourite grandson, that he was holding.*

*I am not there anymore.*


*After he died, we looked for a nice photo of him to frame.*

*We looked in all the old albums.*

*This photo of my Daa with his grandson seemed to be*

*The only clear photo we had of him.*


*So, we gave it to one of those studios,*

*Asked them to remove me from the photo,*

*And print it,*

*So that we could hang it in the wall,* 

*Put a garland around it.*

*I didn't like it - Why remove me?*


*Apparently, you cannot put a garland around the photo of a living person...*

*But I should have been there in the photo.*


*Anyway, that's why his left hand in the photo looks a bit unnatural.*


*Otherwise, he looks elegant.*


*I look at him.*

*I try to imitate his posture but I cannot.*

*And it makes me feel uncomfortable I do not know why.*


*I light a cigarette and wonder*

*If there is any commonality between the two of us.*


*And it occurs to me that*

*I light a matchstick just like him.*


*There are other things that I have inherited from my grandpa -*

*The skin tone, the obsession with writing,*

*The stubbornness,*

*Probably, the absent-mindedness too...*

*Definitely, the affinity towards Communism.*


*But I cannot sit like him.*

*I should have been there in the photo.*


*I have only good memories of him - that's kind of unnatural.*

*He died when I was fifteen.*

*So, he was there for a long time,*

*Not long enough though.*


*And yet, I cannot think of one single reason*

*To be angry with him.*

*And that's not because he is dead.*


*I have always found it difficult*

*To be blind to the wrong things*

*That even people I love do,*

*Even if that person is me.*

*That's why, I think, I am perpetually disturbed,*

*Struggling to find a balance, to fit in.*


*So, that I have no ugly memories of my grandpa*

*Is kind of unsettling.*


*I think it's good that he is not alive.*

*That he died when I was fifteen.*

*For if he had lived longer,*

*I probably wouldn't have had only good memories of him.*


*But I should have been there in the photo.*
