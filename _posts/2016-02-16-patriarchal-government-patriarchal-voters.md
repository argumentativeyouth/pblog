Why does the cost per student of any institute run by the government matter? Does it mean that if they spend crores of rupees on each student, the students will not have the right to question the government?

No wonder ours is still a patriarchal society... "Baap ke paiso se ayyaashi kar rahe ho. Jo bolta hu wahi karo...Warna ghar se nikal jao..."
