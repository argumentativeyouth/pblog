title: It snows Only Once In Our Dreams

*I have read it somewhere*

*That "It snows only once in our dreams."*

*What about real life?*

*I say it snows twice,*

*And that's inside your head.*


*And it rains once, in your mind,*

*When*

*You glimpse her feet*

*As she gathers the folds*

*Of her skirt in one hand*

*And walks towards you.*

*It rains then*

*And the fragrance of wet earth*

*Fills you.*

*And you feel her*

*Everywhere.*


*But it snows*

*As I said, inside your head*

*First when she walks away,*


*And then*

*After years of waiting*

*Sitting on the bank of*

*A river named Eternity,*

*Which wept with you*

*All these years*

*As it reflected*

*The long lost tales of*

*Your wee hours, your childhood, your youth,*

*And a bit of your present...*


*And you realize,*

*With every passing moment*

*How you grew old*

*And how time betrayed you*

*Growing younger everyday.*


*Just then it snows for the second time*

*Inside your head*

*As ripples are formed in*

*The stagnant water of Eternity*

*And you see*

*The fair lustre of*

*Her feet drifting again*

*When she arrives*

*From nowhere*

*And walks towards you*

*Wading the water*

*Carelessly lifting her 'Saari'.*

*Yes, it snows then.*


*And you take revenge on time.*


*You take her in your arms...*
