My mom never ceases to amaze me...

When she and dad came to Bangalore a couple of months back and I saw her for the first time in more than two years, I felt guilty. She had become so thin and weak. I even sensed a certain kind of helplessness in the way she talked, if you know what I mean.

And a part of me thought, not regretting the choices I have made though, that I should have taken care of her. I had always seen her as a strong woman working like crazy both at office and home, making all the hardest decisions, and taking care of us. She had been one of the best inspirations in my life. And there she was, sitting before me in the hotel room, looking all old and fragile...

Anyway, she called me up a couple of days back and said, "I got another promotion... It means more responsibilities, more work, and a transfer to another town... But I am willing to take it. What do you think?"

What do I think? I think that she is still the tiger she had always been - energetic and ambitious - despite her health issues. Of course, I couldn't say that. But I have never been so happy since I last saw her. Probably, the way I felt, a part of it is a psychological defence mechanism to fight with my guilt - a kind of self-assurance that she is alright - a kind of escape route. But it doesn't matter. At least, I know that the fire inside her is still alive. And this means a lot to me...

Anyway, I said, "You. Must. Take. It. Maa."

I could tell her from the way our conversation continued that that's all she wanted to hear.
