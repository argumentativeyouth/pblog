*Sitting beside me on the rickshaw, my mother*

*Wipes her eyes, "Why are you crying?" I ask.*

*She forces a smile,*

*I am five years but I have learned to see*

*The subtle differences in her real and forced smile.*

*"I am not crying," she says. I have reached my school.*

*She kisses me and I get down from the rickshaw.*


*It irritates me when she kisses me in front of my school friends,*

*But I do not say anything today, and that makes her smile a real smile. And I feel good about it.*


*I go to my class. I wonder, while Shiv Shankar sir does the sums on the board,*

*If my mother's tears have anything to do with*

*The loud exchange of words she had had with my father earlier this morning,*

*Words that are not yet in my vocabulary.*


*I do not ask anyone the meaning of those words.*

*Nor can I concentrate on the numbers on the board.*

*I learn nothing.*


*Except that it is good to be quiet.*

*And that I shouldn't become like my father.*

*"Don't become like your father," my mother often says*

*Late at night when my father has thrown us out of*

*"Our" one-room flat*

*And we spend the rest of the night on the terrace,*

*My mother and I.*

*And I whisper, "I will not become like him," while she*

*Covers me under her saari to save me from the mosquito bites.*

*I have always focussed on what not to become.*

*So, when my girlfriend said how her ex,*

*Who used to spend hours on the phone talking to her,*

*Stopped picking up her calls after a three year long relationship,*

*I said to myself, "I will not become like him."*


*So, when we are fighting and she calls me up to yell at me,*

*I pick up her phone though I know she is about to yell at me.*

*"Why are you not saying anything?" She asks,*

*And I say that I have a very weak vocabulary.*


*Which is true, you see.*

*But that melts the ice. She laughs.*

*And I feel good about it.*


*"You manipulative son-of-a-bitch," she says after we have made up.*

*And I do not try to convince her that I really have a weak vocabulary.*


*It's good to be quiet, you see.*
