title: Individualism What?

If you hear words like "Idiot", "Stupid", "Useless", etc., directed at someone else and yet you wonder if they were meant for you, it means you live in constant fear and with a certain kind of inferiority complex that you are not good and smart enough...

But don't blame yourself. It happens when the world has certain 'standard' definition of a good life and they impose it upon you. Doesn't matter whether or not you wanted it.

If you fail in the conventional way of living and prospering, you are bound to feel that way...

In the Indian context, you will feel that way if you are a failed doctor or engineer, or worse, if you couldn't even make it to the engineering and medical colleges... not that you wanted it. But this culture doesn't respect individualism...
