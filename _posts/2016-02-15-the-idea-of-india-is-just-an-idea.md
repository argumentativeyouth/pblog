title: The Idea Of India Is Just An Idea

I am anti 'so called India', for it was never united in the truest sense of the word. Just because our history books have glorified this idea of India as dreamt by some of our leaders who were Utopian, doesn't mean it's practical... It's noble though; the idea is beautiful... But that way, the entire world without any border is beautiful too...
