Last month, on my way home, I had a few hours layover in Kolkata before my next flight.

Bored, I started reading a book. But I was interrupted by the voice of the Great Leader.

A man, in his late 50s maybe, sitting beside me, was watching the Man Vs Wild episode featuring the Great Leader, in his smart phone.

Like seriously? Do people really go back and watch his old coquetry when there is never any dearth of newer ones?

Anyway, uncle *ji* looked very amused and impressed.

I think he noticed me noticing him and couldn't resist saying something, expressing his admiration for the Great Leader to be precise.

"Look at him. He is so fit," he said.

I just smiled.

"In fact, half of your generation isn't half as fit as he is..." he continued.

I couldn't help but wonder where Bhakts get these statistics from. I mean be it the '3000 condoms found in JNU on a daily basis' remark by a BJP MLA or this uncle *ji*'s playful use of fractions to elevate the Great Leader, it is amazing.

Then I remembered that Mathematics didn't help Einstein discover gravity.

Anyway, I had to say something. So, said, "Yeah, I agree. Even I am not physically fit."

"How would you be? You guys have spent half of your life sitting in front of a computer... Look at him, even at this age, he is doing such daring stuff... Like it's a game."

What daring stuff?

I had had enough. I strongly felt the urge to say something to this all-knowing uncle *ji*. How bad could it get anyway?

"I agree, sir. But all this physical fitness won't help him at all in one game..."

"What game?" He asked.

"Truth or Dare..." I replied.

"What?" He looked confused.

"This is a game he will never play..."

"Why not?"

"Well, he can choose neither of the two options and play the game honestly... What if he opts for Truth and people ask him about what he did in 2002? What if he chooses Dare and people ask him to appear for a press conference or to show his degree? Do you think he will be able to play this game honestly?"

Clearly, he wasn't the least bit of amused. He said, "Who said he has to be honest?"

"Of course," I said and got up. There's no point talking to someone like him.

I pushed my trolley to the other side of the lounge. I sat down, took out my laptop - afterall, I belong to a generation who spent half of their life in front of the computer.

Then I created this meme.
