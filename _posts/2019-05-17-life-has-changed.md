When I was 6-7 years old, I used to fantasize myself as a Superhero (inspired from all those Cartoon Network shows) , fighting the evils, just before falling asleep…

When I was 9-10 years old, and I thought I was in love with someone (thanks to the media), I used to fantasize myself as SRK, singing “tujhe dekha to yeh jaana sanam” in a mustard field, with a tiny, little Kajol from my class in my arms…

When I was 13-14 years old, I used to fuck her (or whoever turned me on) in my imaginations (forgive me if you are offended, but it was just the beginning of my adolescence years).

When I was 18-19 years old, I used to have mental sex with everyone I found “sexy” in real life…

2-3 years back, I used to imagine myself asking the most uncomfortable of questions to corrupt politicians and godmen, lying on my bed waiting for sleep to put me under…

Life has changed so much…

Now, I just imagine everything I write to be ranking in number 1 position in Google.
