The last four years of my life have been extremely remarkable in many ways.

First, during my Masters and then at work, I feel I have been on a steep learning curve all these times â€“ the kind that I had never experienced before.

One of the best things that I have learned or maybe I should say an attitude I have developed during this period is to completely ignore the way a feedback is given to me.

I mean I have learned to accept the harshest of words, the most derogatory of criticisms.

I have mastered the art of filtering the message and ignore the rest, at least for the time being. And trust me, the moment I stopped focusing on the way the message was delivered to me, stopped giving a fuck about my ego being hurt, I started to improve.

Ego is a bitch in any kind of relationship.
