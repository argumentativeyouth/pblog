title: Sociable People Are Psychotic Bore

Sociable people are boring. They do not see or feel things beyond what is significant by conventional standards... They dismiss everything else... Even the most intelligent or adventurous person isn't an exception in this case. And hence, even the most original of observations of such person lacks originality, if it makes any sense...

There is something astonishingly bold in being comfortable with solitude, with loneliness, even though it is always associated with sadness - a certain kind of voidness that nothing can fill.

But then again, that's what makes a loner bold, for voidness is the fact of life.

I would rather spend my time having a conversation through glances with a boring person with apparently no life than dancing to the tune of people in a crowd who in the process of being sociable have lost their sense of perspective, have become psychotic bore...
