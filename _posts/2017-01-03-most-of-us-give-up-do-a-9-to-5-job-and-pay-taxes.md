The charcoal pencil set I want to buy costs almost 1500 bucks... Let's not talk about colours and brushes.

The fictional book I have been contemplating to write for the past few years, needs extensive travelling (YouTube videos and travel blogs do not help much). But travelling too is expensive, even if you are OK with sleeping under the shed of a roadside shop (which is risky; people are starving, you see).

The few songs I have composed in my engineering days need access to a studio and people who can play instruments, to make them presentable, none of which comes in an affordable price. Few years ago, I asked a studiowallah in my home town, and he said he charged 2000 bucks per hour for his studio. I gave up music after that (not the kind of person who relies on Indian Idol kind of platforms).

Photography these days doesn't just mean having the right kind of eyes and any decent camera; it means having expensive DSLRs, the right kind of lenses for the right kind of photography, lighting equipments, and after all these, some softwares to edit your photos : none of which I can afford...

Damn! Even writing a decent research paper needs one to have a credit card so that they can register in an academic website, to have "free" access to other research articles...

No wonder most of the people like me give up, choose to do a 9 to 6 job, and pay taxes...
