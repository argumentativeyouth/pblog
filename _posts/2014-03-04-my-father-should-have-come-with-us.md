*When I was a kid*

*And we were poor*

*And we had nothing to eat at night,*

*On the terrace of our small house,*

*We would sit,*

*Me and my mother,*

*Staring at the night sky,*

*Because my father*

*Who was mad at her*

*For she couldn't give him food to eat,*

*Wouldn't let us*

*Stay inside the house.*


*And*

*I would feel sleepy*

*But hunger*

*And mosquitoes wouldn't let me sleep*

*And my mother,*

*Driving the mosquitoes away from me with*

*One hand*

*And*

*Caressing my hair with the other*

*Would say,*

*"Have some sleep,son."*

*And I would ask her,*

*"Why are we so poor, mother?*

*Why is it that we don't have food*

*Or a beautiful house?*

*Why is it that we do not have anything?"*

*And she would stop for a while*


*And then*

*She would say,*

*"Who said we are poor?*

*And that we don't have anything?*

*Do you see the sky with all these stars?"*

*"Yes",I would say.*

*"All this sky above us,this house,*

*With all the stars are ours",*

*She would say.*

*And I would ask,*

*"What about the moon?*

*Is it ours too?"*

*"Yes,it is,*

*But today*

*We've given it to others*

*For they're really poor*

*And they do not have a house*

*And they sleep on the roadside*

*In the dark."*

*And I would believe her*

*And fall asleep*

*In her lap*

*Only to wake up*

*By a drop of tear from my mother's eyes.*

*"What is it?",I would ask.*

*"It's raining",She would say*

*And cover me with her saari*

*And I would fall asleep again.*


*And now*

*Every evening I sit in my balcony,*

*My old father sits beside*

*And we both stare at the night sky,*

*And he says that he feels lonely all the time,*

*Even though he has everything now.*

*He misses my mother, I know,*

*But does not say anything*

*And I look at the sky,*

*And the stars and the moon,*

*And when it rains,*

*I touch the raindrops*

*And I think*

*That*

*My father should have come*

*With us to the terrace*

*Back in those days*

*When we were poor*

*And we had nothing to eat at night...*
