So, my mom has finally given up.

She said, "Go to a court if you want to and get married... I won't mind. But get married..."

Not that I believe in marriage but I heaved a sigh of relief.

Marriage for me means 1+1 converts into 100 + 100 in one single da, if you know what I mean.

I have always believed in the saying - Two is company, three is crowd. And dealing with a crowd of 200 on the day of my marriage and then all through my life isn't something I can think of even in my wildest nightmares.

I have also learnt it hard way that being inaccessible, unless your presence is really needed, is a key to happy life. It means less people and lesser expectations from you... That's why I barely receive calls from my relatives...

Being a bachelor, not necessarily single, in a country like India is blissful...

At the same time, I am practical enough to know that it is difficult to live without getting married, especially when you are in love with someone... Like it makes it difficult to get a rented house or even a hotel room. And then if you are the kind of person who wants to have kids, there are multiple things to worry about...

So, a part of me has somehow convinced myself that if such problems arise, I will get married... But at the court... With no relatives around.

And after my mom said what she said, I felt relieved. At least, 70 percent of our relatives wouldn't approve of it and that means a more peaceful life than the worst case scenario...

And no matter how selfish I sound, I do love my parents... Not that it would have stopped me from not opting for court marriage if the need arises... I mean it just made the entire thing easier...

Anyway, I told her, "Why? So that you can blackmail us saying that you are getting old and it's high time we gave you grandkids? Not happening..."
