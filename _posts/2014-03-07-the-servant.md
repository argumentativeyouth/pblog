*If you ask me*

*To tell you a story tonight,*

*I would tell you*

*The one about his past*

*And present*

*And what lies in between.*


*'Who is he? Who is he?'*

*You ask.*


*And I say,*

*That doesn't matter.*

*He has an extinguished past*

*And his 'today's have violated privacies.*


*And what lies in between*

*Is the debris of his soul*

*And broken dreams*

*And a few hollow words*

*He never dared to utter.*


*But let me tell you*

*That they grew up together*

*And while he was busy with the laundry*

*And kitchen,*

*She fell in love...*


*And he has seen a lot of her love*

*In those crumpled chocolate wrappers*

*She collected.*


*He has seen a lot of her love*

*In those late night phone calls*

*And many such things for years*

*And lastly in those all saying*

*Eyes of her*

*While she uttered, "I do..."*


*As the monsoon found its way*

*Into his already devastated room,*

*A photo of her*

*He had kept all these years*

*Came flying to me*


*And I kicked him out.*


*Standing in our balcony, holding her hand,*

*As I looked at him leaving,*

*Wading carefully through the knee deep water*

*As though any haste on his part would hurt it,*

*I realized*

*How madly they were in love all these years;*

*He, with her*

*And she,*

*With the lunatic poet writing this poem.*
