Someway or the other, I have to see things that are disturbing.

Last night I was on my balcony as usual, trying to make smoke rings while having imaginary conversations with stray dogs down on the dimly lit, otherwise lonely street.

Our adorable conversation was interrupted by a super noisy bike. It was a delivery guy from one of those food delivery services; it was obvious from his uniform and the huge box at the ass of his bike.

He stopped the bike a few buildings away from my apartment, rested it in the sideways along with the other bikes, locked it, and went inside the building, empty-handed... Probably he stays there.

Anyway, then I saw a beggar, an old man who limps, whom I have seen a couple of times in this locality...

He too saw that delivery guy. While he was passing by that bike, he paused for a moment and then knelt down; he then put his nose on the lid of that huge box at the ass of the bike...

And he smiled. Then he got up and walked away...

He took the fragrance of food, good food, something he has never tasted probably...
