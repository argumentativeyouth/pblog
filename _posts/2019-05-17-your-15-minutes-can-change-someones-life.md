I screwed up royally the first interview I was called for after my Masters. The written exam went well. But I could barely answer the questions the interviewer asked me during the face-to-face interview.

What made it more embarrassing was the fact that I was very confident about getting the job. And it turned out I was not at all fit for the job.

Anyway, the interviewer, despite having wasted so much of his time already on someone as worthless as me, gave his honest feedback. Even after being absolutely clear that I was not getting the job, he spent around half an hour explaining where I was lagging behind and what I needed to do if I were to get a job.

This feedback helped me a lot in terms of preparing myself to appear for the next interview. And this time, I got the job.

Anyway, what I am trying to say is that employers should always give their feedback to those they interview, even if they realize the person being interviewed is not fit for the job.

You never know, someone’s life might change if you waste 15 more minutes of your life.
