When I am drunk
Even darkness makes more sense to me…

I never take a wrong step,
I never ever trip over and fall…

I have made some of the best 
Decisions in my life
When I was not sober…

They say it doesn’t make sense…

They say I am insane…

Don’t blame the alcohol,
Don’t curse the alcoholic…

The real world is senseless…

“Sobers” know it too…

Drunkards know it better…
