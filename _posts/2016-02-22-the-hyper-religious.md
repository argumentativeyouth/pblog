Being hyper-religious is always associated with insecurity...

You are always in the fear of being proved wrong. And hence hyper-religious people look for validation from more authentic or so called authentic sources..

They can go to the extent of validating their claims from the findings of their arch-enemy school of thoughts, science, for example...

One example could be that pic making it's round on Facebook every now and then that says that "even NASA says that the Vedic Mantra OM resembles the sound of Sun...Proud of being an Indian, a Hindu.." something like that...

Or the one which says that Sanskrit is the most compatible language for computers, so we need to be proud of being an Indian...

Whether or not these claims are true is an altogether different issue.

To feel proud of something, one, at least, needs to have a clear knowledge of what that 'something' really is, forget having any real association with that 'something'... It needs to be your own achievement, not a reflected glory...

Second, do you really know about what you are saying? For example, are you equally good at computer languages and Sanskrit? Can you recite (if not explain) ten Sanskrit slokas without taking a breath? Or do you know what 'Om' and what 'vibrations of Sun's coronal loop' really means? Do you know what else the sun radiates, emits, or whatever? If you don't, aren't you just looking for the minimum of resemblance with something more authentic to prove your point without giving a damn about what it really means? Aren't you insecure about your beliefs?

P.S.: I guess it was the same reason why even the educated lots digested it when The Great Leader said that Lord Ganesha was the result of plastic surgery. If a nose can be replaced, why not head?

P.S. 2: This insecurity theory, I guess, holds good for other ideas as well, for example, nationalism, patriotism, and the likes...
