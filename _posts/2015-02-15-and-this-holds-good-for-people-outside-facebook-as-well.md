title: And This Holds Good For People Outside Facebook As Well

It's true that I have a family in facebook. And that includes many people I haven't seen in person. I haven't even talked for once with some of you. But all of you mean a lot to me cause somewhere I have realized that there is something common between us (something I never expect from most of my blood relatives). Of course, there are a few relatives too, and you are there for the same reason.

I don't give a flying fuck to what your political beliefs are (Yes, I have many Moditards too in my friend list, some of them are very close to me), I don't care if you are an atheist or not, I don't care about any damn thing as long as you are not imposing it on me.

I might get irritated at times seeing a post of yours, may go on to have a confrontation with you on this; or when you send me stupid game requests or 'Who is going to be your Valentine this year' request. But I will never unfriend or block you for that. So you may do as you please.

But I want all of you to know that there is one thing I will never ever tolerate. And that is insulting my girl Pallabi in anyway, even if it means passing a comment about her to me. If that happens, I am going to unfriend you no matter who you are. If you like me, be nice to my girl.

I won't give a damn about what your intentions were or if you were kidding. She is the most important person in my life and I don't want anyone to insult her in any way. And since I have chosen her, I have no right to hurt her too. And keeping you in my friend list even after knowing how you feel about her no matter what your reasons are is equivalent to being disloyal to her, which will hurt her.

She is MY girl, and I am going to spend MY life with her,not you. So it's none of your business. If you don't like her, keep it to yourself or unfriend me.

At this, I would love to share one of the most common incidents. Two or three
girls have told me that my girl looks strict,arrogant and that they are 'scared' of her.

Well, she is strict and arrogant. And I am happy that she is that way. You know why? Cause no girl is sexier than a girl with fire in her. I am happy that I can't control her and she is not gullible like you. I might sound rude but trust me, girls are more beautiful when they are like that. I have more respect for girls like her than the ones who aren't.

So, if you find it rude, you can go unfriend me. If you do not, please don't tell me again how my girl friend is, especially when you don't even know her personally. It's none of your business.

It is one such incident. There are others too which I don't want to share here.

I might sound melodramatic and cheesy but I mean every word I have written here. So better think before you act.
