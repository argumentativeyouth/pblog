So, it has been exactly 100 days since I quit boozing. This was one of my resolutions that I made sometime in the middle of last year.

My alcohol consumption had reached dangerous levels towards the end of my masters course, especially after I had submitted my dissertation in January last year. Part of it was because I had nothing to do. The course was too hectic that needed one to work their ass off even during the vacations and now, with the dissertation being submitted, there was nothing else to do.

I had enough time even after making 5-6 sketches, reading around 100 pages, and writing 4000 words everyday. I had enough time to think about the uncertainty of the future - what I would be doing after the course was over. After going through all this shit, quiting my engineering career for this course, distancing myself from my parents and relatives, irritating the shit out of some other people, the mere thought of spending even 15 days without a job after the exams was unbearable. Hence, the shotrcut - alcohol.

But thankfully, I came to my senses soon. Especially, after I got this job and I realized I was doing well. And I decided to quit alcohol. But by then, I had already become quite dependent on it.

So, it took time - to be mentally prepared to deal with the aftermath of quiting it. But I did it and it has been 100 days now.

Also, in the last one month, I have attended three parties where there was booze. But I didn't feel any cravings for it. So, I think I am officially clean. Yaay!
