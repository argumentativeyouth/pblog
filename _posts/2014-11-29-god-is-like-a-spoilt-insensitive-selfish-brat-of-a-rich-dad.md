Seven reasons why God is like a spoilt, insensitive, selfish brat of a rich dad:

1. If things do not go his way, he gets irritated, annoyed. In fact, he fumes. His Id instincts (Id, Ego, and Super-ego are the three parts of the psychic apparatus defined in Sigmund Freud's
structural model of the psyche) is so extreme that he doesn't give a shit to what is ethical and what is not. And it is for the same reason he needs to be pampered all the time.

2. You cannot touch him or go anywhere near him unless you are washed and bathed. Because he is highly sensitive to germs. Now it's not as if the rich man's spoilt brat is always spic and span but the thought of mixing with people and doing things(like washing his own underwear) beneath his status is highly abominable to him. He is too choosy about everything and so is God. He is available only for the rich.

3. God derives immense pleasure in playing with things which are much more needed for other essential purposes. For example, the Hindu Gods(and Godmen) love to bath in milk.

4. Like a spoilt kid with a violent streak, he likes to torture and kill animals (and sometimes humans too).

5. He loves it when people speak about his heroic deeds even if they are false. Now every kid likes fairy tales especially the ones where he is the protagonist. Even the grown ups like it, ego boost you see,but I have seen that it's comparatively more among the spoilt brats of rich dads. Just a personal opinion, I am not imposing it on anyone.

6. You need to buy him expensive gifts (say bribe) to keep him happy and from meddling in your affairs.

7. And the last one, he has no respect for women.

The above points are written keeping in mind the image of the conventional spoilt brat of a rich dad. I have chosen the worst one among them.

Having said that all, I am an atheist and I don't believe in God, but even if I consider that He exists, I think that such a person (or whatever) doesn't need to be worshipped.

**P.S.:** If Bhakts (and that includes followers of any religion) come up with something or abuse me, I am not going to reply, as I have exams. So save your energy for something better...
