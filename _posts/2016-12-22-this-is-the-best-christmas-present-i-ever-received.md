As you know, I was going through a phase of depression, because I am lagging behind in my dissertation paper (A 4 credit paper; thanks to...well forget it; anyway you know the reasons), the submission date of which is 2nd January...

In fact, a part of me was thinking that I was useless in research activities, which is part of this masters course ... even though I have given my best in this paper...

But this morning, I was called for a meeting with the PG Research Director of my department...

And he said that I should work on my last seminar paper (a mini-dissertation kind of thing that I presented in my last semester) to improve it. He said, "We could try to get it published in an academic journal...It was good."

And I realized that I wasn't that bad afterall.

I realised I am not that useless...

I don't know if my research article, the mini-dissertation paper will be published in journal...

But yes, I am gonna pull off the dissertation... I am motivated, you see...
