For your information, Bharat Mata is not a Hindu goddess. She is the goddess of all Indians irrespective of which religion you belong to... Cook up whatever theories you want to about Lord Ganesha, but leave Bharat Mata aside... You are too much of an asshole to even utter her name...

PS: Yes, I am not pro 'so called India', but it's a beautiful idea, and I am Utopian..
