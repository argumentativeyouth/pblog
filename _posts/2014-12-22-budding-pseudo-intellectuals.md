Budding pseudo-intellectuals are the people I disrespect most.

These guys follow a certain idea or a person just because they think it's 'cool' to do so, not going into the details of the idea or having the least bit of idea about the way of thinking of the person they are following. They just know a few terms and phrases relevant to the idea or the ideology his ideal is following and use them whenever the opportunity arises in order to show that they know something...The idea or the person they follow might be very good but accepting it just because others are doing so or because it sounds cool is really the heights of hypocrisy... 

It's like pretending to know everything about the history of Renaissance Art just after reading Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code...
