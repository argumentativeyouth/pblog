**Me:** Do you remember that movie 'English Vinglish'?

**She:** Yes.

**Me:** Do you remember the scene where Sridevi drops an entire plate of Laddoos?

**She:** Yes. So?

**Me:** Just wondering if those were real Laddoos...

**She:** Of course, they were real...

**Me (in a panic stricken voice):** Don't tell me... Shit! I wonder how many takes they had to take to perfect that scene and how many Laddoos were wasted...

**She:** Good night..
