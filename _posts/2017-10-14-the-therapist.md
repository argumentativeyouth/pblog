"What do you do, Pritam?" She asked, the young counsellor who attended me today.

"I write... and make sketches," I was stammering...

She was so pretty. I mean so so pretty...

Actually, no. I have seen more beautiful girls than her. She was less than beautiful but more than pretty, if you know what I mean. But it was her overall personality and the intelligence that shone in her calm eyes that hooked me up - the way she looked through her thick glasses, her measured words - I mean that's how psychiatrists are supposed to be, but there was something else in her.

She stared at me for a few seconds. Or maybe I just imagined it.

"What do you sketch?"

"Mostly portraits... And feet..." And I couldn't help but look at her feet. They're beautiful...

"And what do you write about?"

"I am a content writer for an E-learning platform. But I also write poetry, prose, and political articles," I was still stammering. I wanted to tell her that right now I wanted to write about her or make a sketch of her.

She sensed my nervousness.

"Are you ok talking to me?" She asked. "Or you want to talk to someone else?"

"I am absolutely fine," I said. I just wished it were a normal conversation, not a conversation between a patient and a doctor. That wouldn't be exciting for her, of course.

As for me, a part of me felt happy that at least I was getting to talk to her, the other part was pissed off with myself for I would probably never get a chance to have a deep, meaningful conversation with her...

Anyway, apparently I have improved remarkably since my last counselling. And coming that from her lifted up my mood. And I was thinking what could I possibly do, apart from being the patient, so that I could meet her again.

I came home and told my girl about my latest love story that ended before it started.

She said, "I wish to see her too..."
