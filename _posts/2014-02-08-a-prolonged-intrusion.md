*Sometimes,*

*When the dusk falls*

*And you, standing at your window,*

*With a coffee mug in hand,*

*Look at the crowded street below,*

*And amidst the traffic and trees,*

*Glowsigns and flats,*

*And the chaos of music, mikes and passer by,*

*Under the slate sky,*

*You see a figure*

*Standing there at the crossroad*

*Staring at you...*

*Does it happen to you?*

*Do you see someone standing there sometimes?*

*A blur figure,*

*The face is not clear*

*Yet you know who she is...*

*Does it happen to you, I ask.*


*You stare at her,*

*The coffee turning tepid,*

*And then she comes closer*

*And you talk to her.*

*You ask her how she is*

*And what she does now.*

*She just smiles at you*

*Not saying a word.*

*And you ask why is she here.*

*She smiles again*

*And says,*

*"Let's talk about the bad things... about relationship."*

*"Is it necessary?" You ask,*

*She says, "Yes, it is."*

*And then she says that*

*Relationships are nothing*

*But prolonged intrusion...*

*And she vanishes...*

*You smile*

*And respond to*

*Your six years old dauhgter*

*Who is calling you.*

*Not knowing that*

*The intruder is still here,*

*And that she is not alone,*

*Not knowing that you*

*Have always loved this intrusion,*

*You smile and turn back.*

*But you know*

*That it feels great to be called 'Papa.'*
