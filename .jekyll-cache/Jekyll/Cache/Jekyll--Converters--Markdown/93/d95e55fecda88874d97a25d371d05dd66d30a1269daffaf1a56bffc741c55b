I"Õ<p>When I am drunk
Even darkness makes more sense to meâ€¦</p>

<p>I never take a wrong step,
I never ever trip over and fallâ€¦</p>

<p>I have made some of the best 
Decisions in my life
When I was not soberâ€¦</p>

<p>They say it doesnâ€™t make senseâ€¦</p>

<p>They say I am insaneâ€¦</p>

<p>Donâ€™t blame the alcohol,
Donâ€™t curse the alcoholicâ€¦</p>

<p>The real world is senselessâ€¦</p>

<p>â€œSobersâ€ know it tooâ€¦</p>

<p>Drunkards know it betterâ€¦</p>
