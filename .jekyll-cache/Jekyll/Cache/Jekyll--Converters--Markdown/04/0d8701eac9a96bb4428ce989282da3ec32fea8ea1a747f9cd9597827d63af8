I"Ì<p>Every single day of the last 11 years, Seth Godin published blog posts.</p>

<p>Anybody who follows this marketing monkâ€™s blog would know that Sethâ€™s writings are deep and insightful. His blog is not only a knowledge house of marketing (ethical marketing to be precise) but also teaches one to look at life with a different approach. The qualitative aspect of his writings coupled with the number of blog posts he published that too with such regularity is remarkable.</p>

<p>Seth says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Streaks require commitment at first, but then the commitment turns into a practice and the practice into a habit. Habits are much easier to maintain than commitments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thatâ€™s the important thing about writing â€“ it requires commitment. But once you get a hang of it, it becomes easier. Then there wonâ€™t be any dearth of things to write about. The more you write, the more your eyes open, and you tend to find something worth writing in everything.</p>

<p>There was a time when I used to write a minimum of 4000 words a day. No matter how busy and hectic my days were, I always ensured to meet my daily quota of words. And even after that, I had a lot to write about. It was like I used to stumble upon stories at every step of my life and I was obsessed with writing â€“ jotting them down.</p>

<p>I cannot write like that anymore. I wouldnâ€™t say that I have got engulfed in the practicalities of life. I still wouldnâ€™t dare to call myself practical. Nor do I care about the so-called responsibilities. But I sure have become busier than before and in that process, I have lost, as some of my friends used to say, my gift of seeing stories.</p>

<p>Sethâ€™s words have made me realize that itâ€™s still possible. I can start writing like a maniac again. All I need to do is pull my socks up and make some time every day to look around meâ€¦ and write. Even if all I get to see is a blurry world and all I get to write are illegible scribbles.</p>
