I"e<p>A colleague brought her kid at work.</p>

<p>No sooner had he entered the office, then the cacophony of keyboards and printers with the occasional abuses being hurled at the associates by the pretentious bosses started to feel like a heaviness on his adrenaline-charged six year old body.</p>

<p>He started composing his own noises, which irritated the serious lot who were wading their time and waiting for the clock to tick six so that they could leave.</p>

<p>At the same time, it brought in some life inside the otherwise mechanical, corporate space.</p>

<p>I felt pity for the kid. This isn’t where he should be, I thought. The very next moment it occurred to me that even I shouldn’t have been here.</p>

<p>But we all have bills to pay, don’t we? So, I had to get back to work. But with the out of place noise, it was getting difficult to concentrate.</p>

<p>So, in an attempt to make the kid sit quietly, I asked him to play office-office with me. I handed over a notebook and a pen to him which he threw away.</p>

<p>And he said, “I don’t want to play office-office.”</p>

<p>“Why? Please play with me. No one plays with me here, ” I pleaded.</p>

<p>At this point, he got really pissed off and literally yelled at me, “Why are you forcing me? I don’t want to grow up to work in an office like you people. I want to become an artist.”</p>

<p>A six year old kid, the way he said “No” amazed me. And I thought may be I wouldn’t be in that mechanical, corporate space if I had the courage to say no.</p>

<p>A week later, I gave my resignation letter and quit my job as a telecom engineer.</p>
