I"¼<p>My mother transformed herself many a time in her life.</p>

<p>I do not like changes.
Changes,  I find, are difficult to cope with.
So, eventually,  I developed a certain kind of aversion towards her.</p>

<p>This, she didnâ€™t like, I guess.
Of course, she never told me
But then again mothers barely say anything.
They just shrink with all the words within them
And cease to exist one fine day.</p>

<p>I wonder what happens to the unsaid words.
Do they fly with the ashes?
Or mix with the ground?</p>

<p>My mother transformed herself many a time in her life.
But I never bothered to find out
What brought about all these transformations.
And I wasnâ€™t aware of how it started.</p>

<p>Years later, I saw another woman change.
This time I asked and she said it was needed.</p>

<p>â€œI was comfortable running around in shorts,â€ she said,
â€œBut my mother asked me to cover my body.
Because it was indecent to run
And to show my body.
I had to change myself.</p>

<p>â€œThen when I was married off to a man
And had to move with him to a new city,
Thousands of miles away from my family,
To live with his,
I had to leave behind
A part of my shame and decency â€“ I had to learn to fight,
For once married, every woman is on her own.</p>

<p>â€œAnd just when I was getting comfortable with my fierce avatar,
I had to â€œcalm myself downâ€
For a fierce mother is not good for the child.â€</p>

<p>All these times,
The man remained the same, she said.
â€œThey can afford not to change themselves.â€</p>

<p>And I wondered what were my motherâ€™s reasons for all these changes.</p>

<p>My mother transformed herself many a time in her life,
But I never cared to know the reasons.</p>

<p>Guess I will never know.</p>
