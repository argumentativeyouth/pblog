I"#	<p>“Why did she say yes to you? Was it because you made those stupid sketches or because you wrote love stories for her?” asked my uncle.</p>

<p>And I couldn’t help but walk down the memory lane.</p>

<p>Back in 2010, when I had at last decided to woo Pallabi after trying to live without her for two long years, not knowing how to really get her attention (because I had never worked on it before, not that she was my first love, but I was too much of an egoist), I started making her sketches and writing cheesy love poems in Bengali for her.</p>

<p>In 2012, I moved to the same locality where she lived. And every morning I would get up and drop a ‘good morning’ cartoon at her door. She had still not accepted me but found it cute that I would make a cartoon for her everyday.</p>

<p>Then I went home, for my holidays had started while she was still in Bangalore as her exams were going on. I made arrangements to drop a letter for her everyday, sometimes with a gift, or with a romantic movie in a pen drive. I also remember leaving her money for a meal and writing, in the letter with it, that it was for a date I was missing.</p>

<p>She accepted me in April, 2012. And a part of me thought that it worked.</p>

<p>Later when I asked her if she had accepted me because of those cartoons, sketches and writings, she said, “Nooooo… Do you think I am that superficial?”</p>

<p>“You are not superficial. But why did you accept me?”</p>

<p>“You left me with no choice. You never took a no for an answer. I told you I was a bitch but it fell into deaf ears. I humiliated you, hurt you, you didn’t give a shit. For almost two long years. And after all these, I thought may be if you could deal with my darkest side, you are worth a chance… I was not in love with you when I had accepted you…”</p>

<p>“And now?”, I asked.</p>

<p>And she blushed…</p>

<p>“I didn’t even read many of your Bengali poems…,” she changed the topic. “Your cartoons were OK OK though…”</p>

<p>And I told my uncle that no, it was not my sketches and writings that had impressed her…</p>

<p>“Hummm… Can you control her?”, he asked.
“Nope”, I said and knowing him, I thought he would make fun of me now. But he didn’t…</p>

<p>Instead he said,“Great…you should never let her go…”</p>
