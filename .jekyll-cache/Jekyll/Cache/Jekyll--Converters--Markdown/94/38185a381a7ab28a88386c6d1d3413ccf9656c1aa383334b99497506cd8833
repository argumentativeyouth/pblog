I" <p>I usually do not bring in the religion of a person while referring to them in my stories. I donâ€™t even use their names for people tend to make assumptions about oneâ€™s religion(and never the lack of it) from their names.</p>

<p>But this story is an exception.</p>

<p>And his name is, letâ€™s say, Zafar (it doesnâ€™t matter what his actual name is as I have made the point).</p>

<p>Anyway, Zafar is a colleague. I wouldnâ€™t call him a friend but we do pull each otherâ€™s legs at times, or may be I should say we share a kind of relationship wherein we do engage ourselves in the â€˜professionalâ€™ act of mocking each other just to ensure the other person doesnâ€™t forget their place in the office.</p>

<p>So, today, we were discussing about how people from mainland India fail to recognize people from the North-East and often assume that they are Chinese or Korean. Of course, itâ€™s not always true, I mean the â€˜fail to recognizeâ€™ part â€“ many of them do identify the â€œChinkysâ€ to be from the North East, but they think itâ€™s funny to call them Korean or Chinese. And when they are not being funny, they do not hesitate to question the loyalty of the â€˜Chinkysâ€™ to the idea of India.</p>

<p>But Zafar, educated and charming, who hails from a metropolitan city in mainland India and has travelled all around the world, is not like them, you see. He is open-minded and inclusive. He doesnâ€™t call the North-Eastern people Chinkys.</p>

<p>In fact, he has a big heart. â€œDonâ€™t worry,â€ he assured me today. â€œWe have accepted you.â€</p>

<p>I smiled. â€œYou, someone belonging to a community that the entire India has rejected, are in no position to accept or not accept us,â€ I said, referring to the recent victory of BJP in the Elections.</p>

<p>No, I hate the BJP. They are against everything I stand for. Nor am I a communal person. But who said that you canâ€™t act like one when the situation demands it?</p>
