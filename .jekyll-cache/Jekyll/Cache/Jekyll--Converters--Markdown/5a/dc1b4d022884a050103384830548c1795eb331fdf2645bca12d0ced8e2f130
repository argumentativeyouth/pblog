I"–<p>She sent me this picture while she was on a trip with her boyfriend and apparently, the view of the setting sun, she said, somehow reminded her of me.</p>

<p>â€œI feel honored,â€ I replied, in English. Her English has improved remarkably. I remembered the times when we used to take the help of Google Translate to chat.</p>

<p>â€œBut what has the setting sun anything to do with me?â€ I asked.</p>

<p>â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ she said. â€œDid you ever notice that sunsets are more beautiful than sunrise?â€</p>

<p>â€œI get up at 10 in the morning. I do not remember when was the last time I saw a sunriseâ€¦â€</p>

<p>â€œWhat I mean to say is that sometimes good things happen only at the endâ€¦ like we met just a couple of hours before I left India.â€</p>

<p>She had come to India some years back for a project. We had met at the Bangalore International Airport from where she had to catch a flight to Delhi and from there to Paris. I was making a sketch and thatâ€™s how we started talking.</p>

<p>Over the course of our conversation, she had shared her experiences in India, good and bad experiences (I had written about that in another post) and I had apologized for the bad experiences she had had. Thatâ€™s all I did. I apologized.</p>

<p>She was sitting with her legs resting on the trolley and I noticed her bare feet. I couldnâ€™t help but tell her that her feet were beautiful and anklets would suit themâ€¦</p>

<p>â€œYou think so? Then I will buy a few when I reach Delhiâ€¦â€</p>

<p>She had sent me pictures of her feet with anklets when she reached Paris. And after all these years, she still had them.</p>

<p>â€œYou still wear ankletsâ€¦â€ I said.</p>

<p>â€œYesâ€¦â€</p>

<p>â€œYou know anklets also represent chains, chains that bind women?â€</p>

<p>â€œI know. But donâ€™t we all forge some chains for ourselves and choose to wear them despite the hurt that it brings to the mind? And yet it seems beautifulâ€¦like the setting sunâ€¦â€</p>

<p>She was right. But I decided not to reply to her message. Chains of any kind, be it an imposition, habitual, or emotional is too heavy for me to bearâ€¦</p>
